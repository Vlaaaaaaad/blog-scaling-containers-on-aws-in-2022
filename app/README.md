Tiny modified version of [poc-hello-world/greeter-service](https://github.com/poc-hello-world/greeter-service) so I can track when containers actually start.

## Intended use

The purpose of this application is to be used for my [scaling containers on AWS tests](https://www.vladionescu.me/posts/scaling-containers-on-aws/).
